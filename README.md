# battlebox

A simple program to prepare two-player digital mtg battlebox decks in .txt format. 
Card decks are intended to be uploaded to tabletop apps, such as [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/).

## What is Battle Box?
Battle Box is a Magic The Gathering (MTG) format of play where two players share a large card deck. Check out more info on the battle box format from [Lucky Paper](https://luckypaper.co/articles/a-guide-to-battle-box/) and [Casual Cardboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3K75KYFoAk).

Tabletop apps typically won't have features to share a deck like how a battle box deck would be played in-person. To help make digital battle box playable, this program can take a full battle box .txt card list, split it up and shuffle it, and prepare two .txt deck lists ready for each player to upload. 

Battle box games tend to be short; using this program speeds up deck preparation in-between games.
