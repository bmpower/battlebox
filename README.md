# Battlebox

A simple program to prepare two-player digital mtg battlebox decks in .txt format. 
Card decks are intended to be uploaded to tabletop apps, such as [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/).

Battlebox is a Magic The Gathering (MTG) format of play where two players share a large card deck.
Tabletop apps typically won't have features to share a deck like how a battlebox deck would be played in-person. 
To help make playing digital battlebox accessible, this program can be used to take a full battlebox .txt card deck, split it up appropriately, shuffle it, and prepare two .txt decks ready for upload for each player.

CasualBattleBox.txt shows a sample battlebox deck list for input.
